sentence=An easy but comprehensive Arduino style Event Library for Buttons, Encoders, Encoder Buttons, Analog Inputs, Joysticks and Switches.
paragraph=A comprehensive library that makes working with Buttons, Encoders, Encoder Buttons, Analog Inputs, Joysticks & Switches very easy and efficient. Fires to a single callback for each input event. Callback can easily be shared across multiple inputs to create a HAL-like layer. Read input state (eg the position & encoder increment for pressed and non-pressed actions). Rate limit encoder, analog and joystick events without losing steps (eg easy acceleration or reduce events sent over Serial). Multi-click events (1-n). Long press repeat. Tested on Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32 and Teensy.
